She’s been involved in projects and causes such as We Are One in Three, Bring Back Our Girls, Living Biographies, and various health and refugee organizations. Naturally when war broke out in Syria and there was a need for refugee aide, Kate became deeply involved in the relief efforts in Greece. She spent over 4 months volunteering with, then running the Yazidi camp in Greece. In her words, “I found a part of my soul with my Yazidi brothers and sisters.” Her efforts have lead to the relief and placement of several refugee families. This project is dedicated to telling their story.</p>
