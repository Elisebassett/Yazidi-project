				<h1>The Yazidi Project</h1>

<!--Description-->
		<div class="summary">
			<h1>We are all refugees</h1>
			<p>The Yazidi are a beautiful Kurdish people who follow an old religion related to Zoroastrianism with a rich and vibrant culture. Unfortunately they have been misunderstood by Muslims controlling them for centuries. They are scorned and despised as "devil worshippers” because of their beliefs regarding the "Peacock Angel,” and have been made to be second class citizens. This made them targets for ISIS genocide since 2014.</p>
			<p>Now they have fled their homes in fear of torture, death, and slavery. It is estimated that approximately 7,000 Yazidis were captured by IS as they attacked Sinjar in August 2014. The latest figures from the Directorate of Yazidi Affairs in the KRG (as of June 2017) shows that 3,048 people have been able to return to freedom from IS captivity over the last three years, of whom 1,092 are women and 334 are men, and 1,622 children; 819 female and 803 males. But as many as 1,636 abducted women and girls and 1,733 men and boys remain unaccounted for, and many more have died in captivity.</p>
			<p>The captives’ treatment at the hands of IS militants is invariably brutal but differs based on the genocidal strategy employed against them: young women and girls were exploited as sex slaves, forcibly converted and in some cases forcibly married; boys who have not yet reached puberty were brainwashed and trained as child soldiers; and in some cases, men and older women who were forced to convert to Islam were relocated and used as forced laborers.</p>
			<p>This project is dedicated to telling the stories the individuals who have survived and fled to Greece, and now need our compassion, and our help.</p>

						I remember we traveled a lot from village to village, and my husband found a couple of jobs
						and I was taking care of the children and was cooking for my kids. I have five girls and one son.
						I lived in Hadana right before [the genocide].

					<h3>Smer Brahim Bajo</h3>
					<p>
						Before the genocide, I had 9 or 10 shops. I had a very wonderful life. I had nine buildings, and always let them out. Barbour shops, supermarkets, and I took monthly money from them. 
						I had animals before the genocide. I had 50 sheep. I was living there with four of my children and my wife.

					<h3>Zaid Aliass</h3>
					<p>
						In Rabia, we grew water melons and sold them. My father worked for us, building up buildings. He worked for	us so we could go to school. Before the genocide I was living in Sinjar. We didn't know the IS soldiers were coming. They came out of nowhere.
